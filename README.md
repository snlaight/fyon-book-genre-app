Book Genre App

this is a simple app, which displays an array of books. The books are categorized by genre, as shown on the home page. Each header on the home page leads to a page, which contains only the books of that genre. All the books have a price, whether that be for Paperback, Hardcover, or PDF -- those that don't have a price that falls in one of those categories, show a "Not available message".
